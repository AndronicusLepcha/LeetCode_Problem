## About

As an avid coder and problem solver, I've taken on the challenge of solving LeetCode problems to enhance my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. This repository serves as a record of my journey and achievements.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different categories, each containing LeetCode problems related to a specific topic. Below is an overview of the categories and the problems they encompass:

- [Array Problems](array/): Solutions to LeetCode array-related problems.
- [String Problems](string/): Solutions to LeetCode string-related problems.
- [LinkedList Problems](linkedlist/): Solutions to LeetCode linked list-related problems.
- [more to come]

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring my solutions or using this repository as a reference, follow these steps:

1. Browse the relevant category directory to find the problem you're interested in.
2. Inside each problem's directory, you'll find a README with the problem statement, my approach, and the code implementation.

Feel free to use these solutions as a learning resource or as a reference to compare your own solutions. Keep in mind that problem-solving is a creative process, so there can be multiple valid approaches to a given problem.

## Contribution
